# Pathfinding Visualizer

A project that allows you to visualize pathfinding algorithms.

&nbsp;
![Demo](https://github.com/MiniCube11/pathfinding-visualizer/blob/2eb5ff8f80dff6b6ebde8d033c02d71fcd147ba3/screenshots/demo.gif)

## Algorithms
* Breadth First Search - unweighted, guarantees the shortest path

* A Star Search - weighted (there are no weights in this project yet), uses heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path

## Getting Started

To run this project on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed

2. Install pygame
```
pip install pygame
```
3. Run `main.py`
```
python main.py
```

## Using the project

`Click` to add or remove walls

`Space` to start the visualization

`S + Click` to set the starting node

`T + Click` to set the target node

`R` to remove path

`C` to clear graph

`A` to switch to next algorithm
